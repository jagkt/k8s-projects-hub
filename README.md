# ðŸš€ Kubernetes Mastery Lab

This repository is a **hands-on portfolio of Kubernetes projects**, designed to simulate **real-world cloud-native challenges**.  
Each folder acts as a **chapter**, showcasing a specialized area of Kubernetes â€” from **infrastructure automation** to **service mesh**, **security**, and **multi-cluster management**.  

Whether you're a developer, DevOps/SRE, or cloud engineer, this repo demonstrates practical solutions for building **scalable, resilient, and production-ready systems**.
